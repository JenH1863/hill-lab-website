I am a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at Afrobarometer, where I architect scalable AI and data platforms for global research impact. As the organization's founding engineer, I built a centralized API platform from scratch that enables major institutions like the World Bank to access critical survey data reliably.

My expertise spans Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG architectures, and full-stack development using modern tools like TypeScript, FastAPI, and Docker. I am passionate about translating complex data challenges into robust, production-ready machine learning solutions that solve real-world problems.

Based in Lansing, Michigan, I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and actively contribute to the tech community through open-source work and writing. I continuously explore emerging trends in generative AI to build systems that drive meaningful insights.
