Style Target: Modern, program-forward, scientifically serious, restrained.

I. Design Philosophy

The website must communicate:

This is an active research program, not a faculty profile.

The lab has defined scientific questions and programs.

The lab produces rigorous, high-impact work.

The lab is a team.

The lab is open to trainees and collaborators.

The tone should be confident, concise, and programmatic.
Avoid marketing language. Avoid inflated adjectives.
Let structure signal seriousness.

II. Visual Design Rules

Layout

Full-width layout with generous whitespace.

No left sidebar navigation.

Top horizontal navigation bar.

Maximum 5–6 top-level navigation items.

Mobile-responsive (collapses to hamburger menu).

Typography

One clean sans-serif font for headings.

One readable serif or sans-serif for body text.

Large H1 (home headline).

Clear H2 section headers.

Short paragraphs (3–5 lines max).

Avoid dense text blocks.

Color Palette

Primarily white or very light background.

One primary accent color (deep blue, charcoal, muted green).

No bright gradients.

No decorative backgrounds.

Imagery

Use high-quality lab photos.

Use 1–2 clean scientific figures on research pages if appropriate.

Avoid stock photos.

Avoid cluttered collages.

III. Navigation Architecture

Top Navigation (maximum 6 items):

Home
Research
Publications
People
News
Contact

Optional: Join (if recruiting frequently)

Do not exceed 6 primary items.

IV. Homepage Structure

The homepage is not a CV. It is a scientific identity statement.

Section 1. Hero Block

Large headline:

“The Neural Control of Metabolism and Reproductive Function”

One-sentence subheading:
“We define hypothalamic and melanocortin circuits that regulate energy balance, fertility, and motivated behaviors.”

Optional: Single clean lab photo beneath.

No long paragraph here.

Section 2. Research Programs (Core Feature)

Three or four named programs displayed as horizontal blocks or cards.

Example structure:

Program 1
Title: Melanocortin Circuits and Energy Homeostasis
2–3 sentence description.
Link: “Learn More”

Program 2
Title: Neuroendocrine Control of Reproductive Function
2–3 sentence description.
Link: “Learn More”

Program 3
Title: Metabolic Dysfunction in PCOS and Pregnancy
2–3 sentence description.
Link: “Learn More”

Program 4 (optional)
Title: Astrocyte Insulin Signaling and CNS Metabolic Regulation

Each links to its own detailed research page.

This is the intellectual core of the site.

Section 3. Selected Publications

List 4–6 recent or high-impact papers.

Format:
Author list (bold your name)
Year. Title. Journal. Link to PubMed.

Include a button:
“View All Publications”

Section 4. The Lab

Short paragraph (5–6 lines):
Describe lab size, disciplines represented, and training philosophy.

Include:
Button: “Meet the Team”

Section 5. News / Highlights

List 3 recent items:

New grant funded

Paper accepted

Award

Conference talk

Each links to a News page.

Keep this updated quarterly.

V. Research Pages Structure

Each program page should follow the same structure for consistency.

Program Overview (3–4 paragraphs max)

Define the central question.

Define the model systems used.

Define why it matters.

No generic language.

Experimental Approaches

Bullet list of methods:

Chemogenetics

In vivo calcium imaging

Rodent metabolic phenotyping

Hormone assays

Stereotaxic viral approaches

Transcriptomics

This signals technical competence immediately.

Representative Findings

Short structured summaries of 2–4 key discoveries.

Format:
Headline sentence.
2–3 sentences explanation.
Citation link.

Current Directions

1 short paragraph describing active work.

VI. Publications Page

Structure:

Option A (Recommended for low maintenance)

Curated list + link to:
“Complete list on PubMed”

Organize by year descending.

Option B (Higher maintenance)

Automatically generated list from a BibTeX file.

Do not manually format dozens of citations in HTML.

VII. People Page

Structure:

Principal Investigator

Photo
Short scientific biography (not full CV)
Research interests
Contact email

Current Members

Organized by:
Postdoctoral Fellows
Graduate Students
Research Staff
Undergraduates

Each:
Photo
Name
Degree program
1–2 sentence research focus

Alumni

List name + current position.

This signals mentoring success.

VIII. News Page

Reverse chronological.

Each entry:
Date
Title
Short 2–4 sentence description
Optional image

Keep entries concise.

IX. Contact Page

Short and clean:

Lab address
University affiliation
Email
Optional: Map embed

Do not duplicate full institutional boilerplate.

X. Tone Guidelines

Use precise scientific language.

Avoid:
“Cutting-edge”
“Groundbreaking”
“World-leading”

Instead:
“We investigate…”
“We define…”
“We test whether…”

The authority should come from clarity and specificity.

XI. Maintenance Principles

Update publications quarterly.

Add news when something significant happens.

Review people page every semester.

Do not let outdated members remain listed.

Avoid expanding navigation unless essential.

XII. What This Structure Achieves

Modular.

Program-forward.

Scannable.

Scientifically serious.

Easy to maintain with Markdown.

Distinct from university faculty profile.

Strong recruiting signal.

Clear intellectual identity.
